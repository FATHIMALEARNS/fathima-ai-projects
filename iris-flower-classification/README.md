# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses a simple Machine Learning model to classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on features like petal and sepal length and width.

### 📌 Highlights:
- Data exploration using Pandas and Seaborn
- Model training using **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Achieved high accuracy on the test set
- Built as part of my AI learning journey (2025–2027)

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
